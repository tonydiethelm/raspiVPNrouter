# raspiVPNrouter

I am attempting to make a VPN router that will sit 
between my network and my ISP and put all of my traffic on a VPN. 

This is the setup notes for that. 

I am using a Raspberry Pi 3 model B.
I am using two fast ethernet USB dongles, 
which will hopefully not throttle my traffic.
